# 1. Overview of project

<p align="justify"> The purpose of the project is to revise, to analyze and conclude about the “Theater Outcomes by Launch Date” and “Outcomes Based on Goal”. The main objective is to find how successful or failed have been the campaigns by date and by output. Also, which would be the best strategy to reduce the number of failed campaigns. Finally, to revise if it is possible to performed a deeper analysis supported by statistical measures such as central tendency measures. 

# 2. Analysis and challenges

<p align="justify"> The main challenge and difficulty found were the limitation of the data itself. It only provides the months, number of successful, failed, and canceled campaigns. It does not provide more information about a theater subcategory to analyze or to understand the preferences of the people. However, it was possible to segment the data by outputs ranges which it allowed to identify the percentages of successful, failed and cancel campaigns. Also, the data does not specify the currency in which the outcomes and goals are collected. I have done the assumption that is US dollars. 

<p align="justify"> Due to the nature of the data, it was possible only to perform an analysis through descriptive statistics which is defined as a branch of statistics that aims at describing a number of features of data usually involved in a study. The main purpose of descriptive statistics is to provide a brief summary of the samples and the measures done on a particular study. Coupled with a number of graphics and seasonal analysis. Even though, descriptive statistics may provide a good analysis. 

# 3. Theater Outcomes by Launch Date

<p align="justify"> From a total of 1,369 theater campaigns, it is possible to see that 61.3% have been successful, 36% have been failed and 2.7% have been canceled. The average of the successful campaigns is 70, while the average of failed is 41 and canceled 3.

<p align="justify"> It is important to underline that the data shows seasonality, it is possible to see that during the months of May (111), June (100) and July (87) are the best outcomes, which make sense, because is the summer season. During the summer most of the people have more available time to spend in cultural activities. The decline of the outcomes starts during the winter, specifically during November (54) and December (37). This behavior might be explained because most of the people spend their personal incomes preparing the holidays and their spare time is dedicated to local and close family activities. In the other hand, it might be possible that during the summer season most the people spend their personal income in cultural activities and their spare time is share with friends and colleagues.  
In order to reduce the number of failed campaigns that has been addressed during the winter season, a possible strategy to increase the number of outcomes during the winter, it may be to find out or to develop a new niche, based on the preferences and interest of “winter people”. 

# 4. Outcomes Based on Goal
<p align="justify"> The successful or failed of the campaigns are directly related to the outcome goal. It is observed in the following chart that the 71% of successful campaigns based on the outcome goal is located in the range of less than a 1,000 US dollars, while the 58% of the failed are located at the range of greater than 50,000 US dollars.

<p align="justify"> Also, it is observed that the number of campaigns canceled increase as the outcome goal increase. It means that, higher the outcome based on goal is, the greater the failure and/or canceled of the campaign will be. 


<p align="justify"> Although, it will be interesting to determinate what theater campaigns were capable to reach the 47% and 49% of successful (in the range of  35,000 to 39,0000 USD, and 40,000 to 44,999 USD, respectively). A good strategy to reduce the failure and/or cancelation of the campaigns will be to set up more reasonable outcome goals, in this case we can set us a range between less a 1,000 USD and 20,000 USD. 

# 5. Results
 
## **5.1 What are two conclusions you can draw about the Theater Outcomes by Launch Date?**
 
<p align="justify"> The first conclusion is that theater campaigns have been successful, based on the data we can concluded that 61.3% have been successful, 36% have been failed and 2.7% have been canceled. The average of the successful campaigns is 70, while the average of failed is 41 and canceled 3. The second conclusion is that the data behaves on seasonality during the summer is where there are more successful campaigns, while in the winter the number of failed campaigns increase. 
 
## **5.2 What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?**
<p align="justify"> The successful or failed of the campaigns are directly related to the outcome goal. It means that, higher the outcome based on goal is, the greater the failure and/or canceled of the campaign will be.
 
 ## **5.3 What are some limitations of this dataset?**
 
* There was no information about a theater subcategory to analyze or to understand the preferences of the people
* There was no data about the attendees, such as, gender, age, education level, personal income, etc. It is well known that as higher the personal income and/or higher the education level, people trend to spend more money in cultural activities.  
* There was no data about the year. The success of failure of a theater campaign is highly dependent of the year. If there was a specific year in which there was a pandemic or an economic crisis it is obvious that failure theater campaign will be higher in comparison to another year. 
* There was not a clear currency specification for the outcomes based on goal. I have done the strong assumption that the data is reported in US dollars. 
What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
* It might be possible to do a pay chart to present the percentages of successful, failed and cancel of theater outcomes by launch date.
* I think the graph of outcomes based on goal would have been easier to read if it were drawn as bars. 

# 6. More analysis
Another type of analysis, tables, and graphs that it might be possible to do are:

-	## **6.1 Theater Outcomes by Country**
This graph shows that the United States (US) is the country with more theater outcomes with 912, followed by the United Kingdom (UK) with 359 and Canada (CA) with 44.

-	## **6.2 Theater outcomes by subcategory**

<p align="justify"> It this case it is observed that 1,066 of the outcomes came from plays, which represents the 77%, followed by spaces with 187 outcomes, meaning 13%, while musicals have 140 outcomes which means 10%. Also, the percentrage of pledge it is observed that 59% come from plays, 35% from spaces and 6% from musicals. 

<p align="justify"> Finally as the Unites States is the main market, it was decided to do a short analysis with central tendency measures based on this market. It was taking into consideration the succesful campaignes and here are the results:

 ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95872614/146653300-bb4eee1e-6872-4835-88e8-2828bb8bd4c8.png)

<p align="justify"> The were 1,651 succesful campaigns in the United States. The average of goal were 10.5K while the pleadge was 19.3K. The median of the goal was 4K and the pleadge was 5K. The goal mode was 5K and the pleadge goal was 2K. The minimum goal was 1 dollar and the minimum pleadge was 10 dollars. The maximium goal was set up in 400K while the maximum pleadge was captures in 2.3 USD million. 

 <p align="justify"> One of the challenges of this kind of analysis is that the data is given is US nominal dollars, which make the figures too large for the interpretation. In this case, it is observed that the variance and standar deviation figures are very high. However, it could explain that the goal standard deviation is almost 22K while the pleadge is almost 80K. This means that the goal standard deviation is 22K away from its average, while the pleadge is almost 80K away from its average. 

<p align="justify"> Finally, it was possible to determinate some ranges based on the goal and it is obsderved that the major number of successful teather campaigns in the US are located in the goal range of 1000 to 4,999 USD.

Followed by the ones located at the goal range of 5,000 to 9,999 with 313 successful campaigns.
